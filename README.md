1. Click "Create repository from template"

## Installing
1. Open Terminal
2. Run `xcode-select --install` and install the tools using the prompts.
3. Clone your new respository to your local machine `git clone <url to this repo> ~/.dotfiles`.
4. Change your directory to the .dotfiles `cd ~/.dotfiles`.
